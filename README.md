# Overview
Front-End UI for browsing image data for the 350Bush project (https://350bush.wordpress.com). 

# 2D Space-Time Cursor
At its core, this app is a browser/player for navigating video frame data. 90 video clips were recorded along the same path in space (walking down the sidewalk with the camera level with the horizon, pointed north). Those clips were stabilized and normalized to 10sec length, so any given frame in a clip maps to the same location in space in all the other clips. The frames were exported as a 90x90 grid, where space is the horizontal axis and time is the vertical.

# Art/Science
If it isn't obvious, this is an art project leveraging computer vision. I had a silly idea and made it into an immersive interactive experience. I learned some valuable things along the way. Enjoy!
